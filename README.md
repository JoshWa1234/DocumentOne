# DocumentOne
This github repo is to contain all of the code for the Scrum project.

## Forks

Forks are a useful feature of GitHub, it is the key to collaborative work. When you create a fork, it'll simply copy over all of the code from this repo to your own whilst also allowing you to update your repo based on any new additions we do to this repo.

To create your fork simply go to: **Guides -> Forks**. And look at the numbered images **IN ORDER**

These guides will also show you how you can download your repo, how to upload to the repo and how you can update the repo's files based on this repo's updates. We will need this for better collaboration

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests work along side Forks to allow you to simply send any new code you upload to your fork up to review to this repo, this will then let me merge your code into this repo and will allow other people to simply download it.

You can find the guide on how to submit pull requests in: **Guides -> Pull Request Submissions**. From there me or Josh will review the code and push it up.

I am pretty sure this is all you have to know, obviously since you are all new to GitHub just ask me for any help you might need when working with this. Seems like a lot but It'll help us work better (especially with some work I'll be doing during the christmas)

## Future Work

If we simply give our work into Brian and say it was magically working, he will know that we have done some work outside of lessons. So I have created a file called Future Work. In that file you will be able to see each of your names, when I (or if anyone else decides to work on it too) do some work on a section you have been working on, I will leave it in the Future Work dictionary. From there you can simply copy and paste it in (or update your Fork) and pretend like you were the ones that coded it through out the lesson. 

Sadly I cannot match my coding style to all of yours, so you might have to do some refactoring during the lesson to make the code look like you produced it, but you wont have to get rid of any code, just make it look like your code!

***

That is it, I will begin working and merging our parts into the main program. I am pretty sure that by the 3rd or 4th sprint we will have a pretty much functional program!
